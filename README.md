# AI-in-Middle-School-Chemistry
This is the class project for Special Topics in AI course. In this course, we worked on three different topics in chemistry and tried to 
model those topic using Answer Set Prolog(ASP). The topics in chemistry were based on the subject chemistry's lesson plan for middle
school. It is a part of a larger project to see if AI can be used to teach kids in middle school.
